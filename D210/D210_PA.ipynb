    "## Part 2: Storytelling with Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B1: Panopto Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Link\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=8ced4190-46f2-44b7-a625-b107017d9b05\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SummaryContext of Each Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This data set is a large conglomerate of patient treatment information in the context of hospitals. It is packed with data on how patients are treated, how they respond to these treatments, and who these patients are demographically. The goal was to clearly understand how different treatments impact patient outcomes, especially in diverse groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CDC/NCHS Weekly Mortality Data Set: This dataset is broader, covering weekly mortality rates throughout the U.S. It is a crucial tool for spotting trends in public health, understanding what is causing the most harm, and seeing how effective our health policies are across different regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outline of Key Results from Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the most striking findings was the clear link between CDC health issues and WGU data readmission rates. It is striking to see how different regions with a lower percentage of natural deaths (a higher percentage of non-natural deaths) significantly influenced readmission rates and overall treatment success.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The CDC/NCHS data showed how much mortality rates can vary from one region to another. These differences were not just numbers; they depicted how healthcare accessibility and quality vary across the country. Some states had mortality rates as high as double that of other states.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Two Supportive Data Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Symbol Map Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This visualization showed a percent of natural deaths for best and worst states by readmission rates.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        It is recommended that this be used to identify states with higher or lower readmission rates and to determine whether these states also have higher or lower rates of natural-cause to all-cause deaths.\n",
    "        \n",
    "- Tree Map Visualization \n",
    "\n",
    "     - This visualization showed deaths per population for best and worst states by readmission rates.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        It is recommended that this be used to identify states with higher or lower readmission rates and determine whether these states also have higher or lower deaths per population.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary of Actionable Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "There are states with a higher than normal incidence of non-natural deaths per capita. Use this information to identify if these states also have higher readmission rates. Resource allocation can be redirected to these areas for those states that do. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some states have a higher-than-average mortality rate per capita. Use this information to identify if these states also have higher readmission rates. For those states that do, they are good candidates for future expansion of the hospital network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further research is needed to provide exact treatment modalities that affect readmission rates. Use the results here to guide further research into these areas at higher risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3: Reflection Paper\n",
    "\n",
    "### C1: Purpose and Function Alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dashboard is designed specifically to aid in the problems faced in the information from the data dictionary associated with the WGU Medical dataset. The design improves medical readmission rates by understanding healthcare dynamics and contributing factors related to readmission rates. The function of the dashboard is to translate these detailed datasets into understandable visuals. These visuals ensure that the dashboard is not just random data visualizations but a tool to identify specific analytic needs, such as identifying trends in patient readmission and contributing factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C2: Additional Data Set Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incorporating the CDC/NCHS weekly mortality data as an additional dataset adds a layer of information for the WGU Medical dataset. We can draw more conclusions about healthcare outcomes in specific states by overlaying mortality trends on top of the medical data. These variables allow for a comparative analysis of state-based health statistics with national mortality rates, providing a more customizable option for reviewing the data. This combination helps us understand how different regions with different socio-economic standards can influence readmission rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C3: Two Data Representations to Support Decision-Making\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 'Symbol Map by State' representation shows geographical changes in health outcomes, which is essential for executive leaders in identifying factors that may or may not contribute to readmission rates. This visualization will categorize by state and show different visualizations of the natural cause ratio and the readmission rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 'Histogram' offers insights into income distributions against average income, helping executives understand socio-economic factors that might impact readmission rates in certain regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C4: Two Interactive Controls for User Modification\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The filter option in the 'Symbol Map by State' allows users to toggle between top or bottom readmission rates, providing flexibility in focusing on specific areas of interest or concern. This demonstration should help identify factors that share the best and worst states for readmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the 'Histogram,' the state filter allows users to isolate the income distributions to specific states. This option allows the user to dig into the data and identify anomalies in income distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C5: Accessibility for Colorblindness\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In designing the dashboard, colorblindness accessibility is taken into account. This goal was achieved by selecting colors that are distinguishable to individuals with color vision deficiencies. Strict avoidance of red-green gradients ensured that those with specific problems with those colors would be accounted for properly. Light and dark shades were also used to help with differentiation, and blue-orange gradients were due to their safeness for most color-blind issues. Contrasting colors ensured the differences were substantial enough to visualize different data and trends, regardless of the colors used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C6: Two Data Representations to Support the Story\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This presentation aims to convey a compelling story about the importance of understanding and improving readmission rates in healthcare. Two critical data visualizations in the dashboard played a significant role in supporting this goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Symbol Map by State\n",
    "    \n",
    "        This visualization clearly represented natural to all-cause mortality rates, differentiated by a color gradient. The size gradient, indicating readmission rates, allowed for an immediate visual correlation between mortality rates and readmission frequencies in different states.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - By integrating these two healthcare metrics, the symbol map highlighted regions where high readmission rates might influence mortality trends non-naturally. This visualization is vital to our story, as it illustrates the 'where' and the 'why' behind varying readmission rates.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - The interactive filter to change between the states with the highest and lowest readmission rates was instrumental in this narrative. It enables viewers to focus on states with the best and worst readmission rates and identify if these states have higher than or lower than natural death ratios. This comparison is essential for healthcare executives to identify successful strategies from states with lower readmission rates and apply these insights to improve outcomes in states with higher rates.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Tree Map by State\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - The treemap provided an overview of readmission rates against state death rates. This representation offers a quick yet comprehensive view of how readmission rates might correlate with overall mortality rates in various states.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - The ability to filter for top or bottom readmission rates in the tree map allows for a focused analysis of specific states, either to learn from the best practices of states with lower readmission rates or to investigate further the challenges faced by states with higher rates.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - This visualization supported the story by highlighting the need for specific interventions in states with high readmission rates. It underlines the potential impact of these interventions on readmission rates and overall mortality, which reinforces the importance of evaluating readmission rates as a critical factor in improving healthcare outcomes.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "### C7: Audience Analysis Adaption\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In creating the presentation for the Tableau data dashboard, we evaluated our audience described in the audience background portion of the data dictionary to effectively tailor the message to the varied backgrounds and interests of the organization's executive leaders and data analytics peers. The audience included the Senior Vice President of Hospital Operations (SVP), Vice President of Research (VP), a panel of Regional Vice Presidents (Regional VPs), and peers in the data analytics team. Each group has different strengths and weaknesses:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Senior Vice President:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - Focus on insights that could guide operational resource flexing based on risks and needs of the patient population. This analysis emphasized comprehensive variables and their relationship specifically to readmission rates. This audience member has many responsibilities that branch out across the United States. For this reason, the dashboard strongly emphasizes different categories within individual states.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Vice President of Research:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - Focus on factors that show promise in affecting readmission rates. Although this presentation does not dig deep into each factor, it should help this audience member focus on which factors should receive additional investigation and research opportunities. The dashboard includes a broad range of features that all show promise for being future candidates for further company research.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Regional Vice Presidents:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - Focus on the classification of variables into distinct regions. Each VP has a respective region, and although data across the United States is valuable, these VPs care more about their specific regions. This focus led us to the ability to filter by state in various dashboard visualizations.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Data Analytic Team:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - Focus on the technical aspects of the data analysis. Specific data preparation steps and insights and shortcomings of the analysis techniques and results provided were taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C8: Universal Access Design\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The presentation for the Tableau data dashboard was designed with universal access in mind, maximizing the public's use of this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The presentation is published on Tableau Public, ensuring that as many people could access it. It does not require any specific software and can be accessed by anyone with an internet and web browser. The audience described above is diverse, and although some would do fine using external software to analyze and view this data, others would need help to access this easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C9: Two Elements of Effective Storytelling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Organized Flow to the Story (Narrative)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the presentation, we implemented an organized narrative, which is crucial for guiding the audience through the complex data. This narrative began with an introduction to the datasets and the key questions they address. It transitioned to a detailed analysis where we showed patterns and insights and ended with conclusions and recommendations. This structured approach is meant to help the audience follow a clear, logical path through the data, ensuring they can easily follow the ideas explored. The presentation should offer information effectively and keep the audience engaged by maintaining this organized flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relatable Content for the audience\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive elements, such as filters, were incorporated to aid in audience engagement and make the data relatable to real-world applications. Our audience members were primarily, in large part, separated by geographical boundaries. To address this, we made all our visualizations customizable to geographical areas. This strategy is meant to keep the audience actively thinking and finding ways each visualization can help their specific regions.\n",
